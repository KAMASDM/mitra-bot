# Job Search Fix - October 15, 2025

## Issue Fixed

### ❌ **Job Search Showing Both Professionals and Jobs**

**Problem**: 
- When user clicked "Job Search", system was displaying both professionals and job listings
- Job search was using hardcoded text responses instead of real database data
- Experience-level selection was showing placeholder data

**Root Causes**:
1. `handleJobSearch()` was asking for experience level and showing hardcoded job text
2. No actual database query being performed
3. MessageBubble detection logic was incorrectly identifying data type
4. Experience-based handlers were showing static content instead of database jobs

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `handleJobSearch()` to Fetch Real Jobs

**BEFORE**: Hardcoded experience selection
```javascript
const handleJobSearch = () => {
  addMessage(
    "Great! I'll help you find job opportunities. What's your experience level?",
    'bot',
    [
      { text: t('fresher'), action: 'experience_fresher' },
      { text: t('junior'), action: 'experience_junior' },
      { text: t('midLevel'), action: 'experience_mid' },
      { text: t('senior'), action: 'experience_senior' }
    ]
  );
};
```

**AFTER**: Direct database query
```javascript
const handleJobSearch = async () => {
  addMessage(
    "Great! I'll help you find job opportunities. Let me search for available positions...",
    'bot'
  );

  setIsTyping(true);
  
  try {
    // Fetch all active jobs from database
    const { searchJobs } = await import('../../services/databaseService');
    const jobs = await searchJobs({ limit: 50 });
    
    console.log('Fetched jobs:', jobs);
    
    setIsTyping(false);
    
    if (jobs.length === 0) {
      addMessage(
        "I couldn't find any active job postings at the moment...",
        'bot',
        [
          { text: 'Try again', action: 'job_search' },
          { text: '← Back to Services', action: 'back_to_services' }
        ]
      );
    } else {
      addMessage(
        `Found ${jobs.length} job opportunities. Click on any card below to view details or apply.`,
        'bot',
        [
          { text: '← Back to Services', action: 'back_to_services' }
        ],
        jobs // Pass jobs array as data
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching jobs:', error);
    setIsTyping(false);
    addMessage(
      `I'm having trouble fetching jobs right now: ${error.message}. Please try again.`,
      'bot',
      [
        { text: 'Try again', action: 'job_search' },
        { text: '← Back to Services', action: 'back_to_services' }
      ]
    );
  }
};
```

### 2. Improved Data Type Detection in MessageBubble

**BEFORE**: Simple detection that could confuse professionals with jobs
```javascript
{Array.isArray(message.data) && message.data.length > 0 && (
  <DataCards 
    data={message.data} 
    type={message.data[0]?.title || message.data[0]?.jobTitle ? "jobs" : "professionals"} 
    onAction={onDataAction}
  />
)}
```

**AFTER**: Robust detection checking multiple job-specific fields
```javascript
{Array.isArray(message.data) && message.data.length > 0 && (
  <DataCards 
    data={message.data} 
    type={
      // Check for job-specific fields first
      message.data[0]?.jobTitle || 
      message.data[0]?.job_title || 
      message.data[0]?.company || 
      message.data[0]?.company_name
        ? "jobs" 
        : "professionals"
    } 
    onAction={onDataAction}
  />
)}
```

**Detection Logic**:
- Checks for `jobTitle` (camelCase)
- Checks for `job_title` (snake_case)
- Checks for `company` (job-specific)
- Checks for `company_name` (job-specific)
- If any found → Display as `jobs`
- If none found → Display as `professionals`

### 3. Removed Experience-Based Selection

**Removed from Quick Reply Handler**:
```javascript
// REMOVED - No longer needed
case 'experience_fresher':
case 'experience_junior':
case 'experience_mid':
case 'experience_senior':
  handleExperienceSelection(reply);
  break;
```

**Functions now obsolete** (left in code but not called):
- `handleExperienceSelection()`
- `getJobListingsByExperience()`

---

## Database Integration

### searchJobs() Function
Located in: `src/services/databaseService.js`

**Features**:
- Queries `placements` collection
- Filters by `isActive: true`
- Supports filters: jobType, location, experience, salary, company, workArrangement
- Default sort by creation date (newest first)
- Configurable limit (default: 10, we use: 50)

**Query Structure**:
```javascript
export const searchJobs = async (filters = {}) => {
  let q = collection(db, 'placements');
  const constraints = [where('isActive', '==', true)];
  
  // Apply filters...
  constraints.push(orderBy('createdAt', 'desc'));
  constraints.push(limit(filters.limit || 10));
  
  q = query(q, ...constraints);
  const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
  
  return snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data()
  }));
};
```

## Field Mapping

### Professional Fields (NOT shown in job search)
```javascript
{
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  educational_qualification: "MBBS",
  professional_type_id: "3",
  biography: "...",
  years_of_experience: 10,
  hourly_rate: 500,
  is_available_online: true,
  // ... professional-specific fields
}
```

### Job Fields (ONLY shown in job search)
```javascript
{
  jobTitle: "Software Developer",        // or job_title
  company: "Tech Company",               // or company_name
  location: "Ahmedabad",
  jobType: "full-time",                  // or job_type
  experience: "mid-level",
  salaryMin: 40000,
  salaryMax: 60000,
  workArrangement: ["Remote", "Hybrid"],
  description: "...",
  requirements: "...",
